The majority of operations in construction remain undigitized, leading to significant gaps in data analysis and understanding. Traditional manual data collection methods are not only costly and inefficient but also produce incomplete and biased data. Additionally, IoT sensors, while useful, offer limited cognitive understanding and can measure only specific parameters such as location and temperature, failing to capture the complexity of real-world tasks and manual operations. This limitation hinders the visualization and in-depth analysis of construction activities, as these sensors require extensive deployment and complex integration across numerous endpoints.

Reflective AI aims to overcome these challenges by utilizing video feeds from construction sites to capture operations in real time with deep learning-based activity recognition. This approach leverages existing security camera infrastructure and the adoption of low-cost, energy-efficient cameras, further simplifying deployment. The technology provides a comprehensive view of human and equipment activity, enabling the creation of detailed automated logs accessible via a web-based dashboard.

By offering metrics to measure complex operations, Reflective AI transforms previously hard-to-quantify tasks into analyzable data, facilitating the improvement of operational efficiency, cost reduction, and progress benchmarking against schedules. This shift not only digitizes construction tasks but also opens up avenues for optimizing various aspects of construction and manufacturing site operations.
