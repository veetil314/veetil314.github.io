# Bridging the Gap Between Image Content and Product Intelligence: DeepView.ai's Fashion Search Technology

## Executive Summary
DeepView.ai has developed a cutting-edge fashion search technology that addresses the disconnect between image content and product intelligence in the e-commerce industry. By leveraging advanced deep learning image recognition, DeepView.ai enables retailers to enhance product discovery on websites, apps, and social media platforms. This innovative solution has proven to increase conversions by up to 15% within just three weeks of deployment.

## Introduction
Search technology has made significant advancements, with users expecting near-perfect results. However, the e-commerce industry still faces challenges in providing relevant and comprehensive search results, particularly in the fashion domain. Retailers struggle to accurately annotate products with relevant keywords, leading to user frustration and suboptimal search experiences.

## The Problem
Fashion shoppers often have a specific look or style in mind when searching online. They translate this desired look into words and attempt to find relevant products on retail websites. However, two key challenges arise:

1. Translating the desired look into appropriate search terms can be difficult, as many patterns and styles lack clear names.
2. Products must be properly annotated with the words used by the user to appear in search results. Inaccurate or incomplete annotations lead to irrelevant or scarce search results.

## DeepView.ai's Solution
DeepView.ai addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced deep learning image recognition. The AI-powered solution enables retailers to:

1. **Index products with automatic, image-based SMART METADATA**: DeepView.ai's technology reduces the effort required for manual tagging by 80% and improves search results for underserved queries by 5x.

2. **Increase click-through rates on recommended products**: Visual image search enhances product recommendations, leading to higher click-through rates, even for out-of-stock products.

3. **Make user-generated and social media images automatically shoppable**: By matching user-generated content (UGC) and social media images with similar products in the online store, DeepView.ai enables retailers to capitalize on the power of visual content.

4. **Generate automatic hashtags for social media images and improve SEO**: DeepView.ai's technology automatically generates relevant hashtags for social media images, enhancing discoverability and improving search engine optimization (SEO).

## Differentiating Factors
DeepView.ai's solution stands out from competitors in two key aspects:

1. **Natural image compatibility**: The technology works seamlessly with natural images, social media content, and UGC, unlike most image recognition APIs that struggle with noisy or non-professional images.

2. **Product-specific feature generation**: DeepView.ai's system generates product-specific features based on images, rather than generic tags that are irrelevant for search purposes.
