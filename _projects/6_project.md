## Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement Large Language Models from scratch using PyTorch, starting with GPT-2. The primary objective is to explore different architecture and techniques for optimizing performance, and study scaling properties. 


Due to the high cost of GPU resources on popular cloud platforms like Google Cloud and AWS, the training will be conducted using VAST.ai, a more cost-effective alternative, on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, well suited for open source projects that donâ€™t involve proprietary data.


## Research Objectives
1. Design and implement a custom LLM models from scratch using PyTorch, with a focus on exploring architectures and optimization techniques. 
2. Pretrain the model from scratch on open web data. 
3. Analyze the relationship between model size, computational resources, and performance, contributing to the understanding of scaling laws in language models.
4. Use techniques such as Flash Attention and DDP for high speed distributed training. 


## Methodology
### Phase 1: Model Design and Implementation
- Design the model architecture from scratch using PyTorch. Hand code  modules to enable flexibility in exploration of architectures. 
- Start with GPT-2. Follow literature from OpenAI to adopt similar architectures and initialization techniques to benchmark against. 


### Phase 2: Distributed Computing and Optimization
- Integrate DDP into the model implementation to distribute the computational load across multiple GPUs.
- Use Flash Attention, a novel attention mechanism, to speed up the training process and improve the model's efficiency.
- Optimize the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring techniques such as gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training.


### Phase 3: Data Preparation and Training
- Collect and preprocess open web data suitable for training the GPT-2 model.
- Set up the training environment on VAST.ai, leveraging 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for efficient computation.
- Train the model on the prepared data, monitoring the validation loss over epochs to assess the model's learning progress.


### Phase 4: Performance Analysis and Scaling Laws
- Analyze the relationship between model size, computational resources, and performance, considering factors such as training time, memory usage, and validation loss.
- Investigate the scaling laws governing the performance of language models, comparing the results obtained from the custom GPT-2 model with existing literature and benchmarks.
- Explore potential avenues for further scaling the model, such as increasing the number of parameters or adopting more advanced architectures like GPT-3, GPT-J or Mixture of Experts (MoE).


## Expected Outcomes
- Fully functional custom LLMs implemented from scratch in PyTorch
- Insights into the impact of model size on performance and computational requirements, contributing to the understanding of scaling laws. .
- A comprehensive analysis of the model's performance, including validation loss plots and comparisons with existing benchmarks.


## Future Directions
- Investigate the impact of increasing the model size to 1 billion parameters and beyond on performance and computational requirements.
- Explore the integration of MoE architectures to improve the model's efficiency and scalability.
- Conduct fine-tuning experiments on specific downstream tasks to assess the model's adaptability and generalization capabilities.
- Investigate techniques for reducing the model's computational footprint, such as knowledge distillation or parameter sharing.
- Collaborate with the research community to contribute to the development of more efficient and scalable language models.


By undertaking this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of LLM architecture and its scaling properties, while also contributing to the broader field of language model development. The insights gained from this project will inform future research directions and help in the development of more advanced and efficient language models.


The successful completion of this project will demonstrate design, implementation, and optimization of large-scale language models from scratch, and study efficient computing paradigms.
