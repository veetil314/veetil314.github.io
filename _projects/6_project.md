## Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a custom GPT-2 model from scratch using Python, with a focus on scaling the model to 124 million parameters. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the GPT-2 architecture and explore techniques for optimizing its performance and efficiency.

The project involves hand-coding attention modules and leveraging advanced techniques such as Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) for compute scaling and Flash Attention for training acceleration. The model will be trained on open web data, and the validation loss will be monitored and plotted against the number of epochs to assess the model's performance.

Due to the high cost of GPU resources on popular cloud platforms like Google Cloud and AWS, the training will be conducted using VAST.ai, a more cost-effective alternative, on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

## Research Objectives
1. Design and implement a custom GPT-2 model from scratch using Python, with a focus on understanding the architecture's intricacies and hand-coding attention modules.
2. Scale the model to 124 million parameters and investigate the impact of model size on performance and computational requirements.
3. Employ DDP to distribute the computational load across multiple GPUs, enabling efficient training of the large-scale model.
4. Integrate Flash Attention, a novel attention mechanism, to speed up the training process and improve the model's efficiency.
5. Train the model on open web data and monitor the validation loss over epochs to assess the model's learning progress and performance.
6. Analyze the relationship between model size, computational resources, and performance, contributing to the understanding of scaling laws in language models.
