The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the GPT-2 architecture and explore techniques for optimizing its performance and efficiency.</p> <p>The project involves hand-coding attention modules and leveraging advanced techniques such as Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) for compute scaling and Flash Attention for training acceleration. The model will be trained on open web data, and the validation loss will be monitored and plotted against the number of epochs to assess the model’s performance.</p> <p>Due to the high cost of GPU resources on popular cloud platforms like Google Cloud and AWS, the training will be conducted using VAST.ai, a more cost-effective alternative, on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.</p> <h2
