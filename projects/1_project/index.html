Collaborating with one of the largest construction firms in the Asia Pacific region, we leveraged advanced AI-driven video recognition technology to accomplish this. The technology provides real-time, actionable insights into heavy equipment, beginning with dump truck operations, thereby addressing critical operational bottlenecks and enhancing overall project efficiency. </p> <h2>Problem</h2> <p> The initial digitization focus was on earthwork operations, with plans to expand to other areas, including building construction and manual operations. Earthwork is a substantial cost factor in large infrastructure projects, involving numerous trucks transporting materials, excavators performing cut and fill operations and more. Understanding and digitizing these operations was essential but challenging with traditional technologies including IoT sensors, due to the high turnover of independent equipment operators, leading to challenges in deep IoT integration. A camera-based solution emerged as an effective method to bypass these challenges, helping to eliminate bottlenecks, delays, and simplify integration. </p> <h2>Solution</h2> <p> We developed technology to intelligently recognize the fine-grained activity of heavy equipment, such as whether it's loaded/unloaded, counting the number of dumps, and distinguishing between moving and idle states. This approach offers a detailed overview of material movement, utilization, and productivity without requiring complex infrastructure. A few cameras covering the work area, necessary for security and monitoring, are used. An easy-to-use UI generates a smart video summary that highlights key activities like dump truck activity. Heatmaps are created to show areas of high activity over a day or fixed period of time , and metrics reveal the percentage of idle time, detailed equipment activity and the spatial distribution of activity. </p> <h2 id="key-technology-highlights">Key Technology Highlights</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <iframe src="https://vimeo.com/935174600" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" width="auto" height="auto"></iframe> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Recognizing dump truck activity.

Our team curated and extracted web video data, facing the challenge that publicly available construction datasets were often very noisy. Many videos, shot using cell phones at close range, were shaky, necessitating extensive cleanup, careful filtering, and annotation.</p> <h3 id="data-annotation">Data Annotation</h3> <p>We recruited an in-house team of annotators for this project. Developing clear guidelines for the team proved challenging, necessitating an iterative process that included an evaluation phase. During this phase, we continuously refined the guidelines. Annotators were only approved for production annotation after achieving satisfactory accuracy levels in the evaluation phase.</p> <p>Annotation requirements were extensive. The work encompassed various models, including equipment detection, classification, and activity recognition. The diversity of data was also critical. Data was categorized based on various sources to ensure diversity at every level. For instance, stock videos are generally cleaner, whereas YouTube videos are noisier. Longer videos were not overrepresented to avoid repetitive occurrences of similar images within the dataset.</p> <p>Various annotation tools were used, such as CVAT and Labelbox.</p> <h3 id="active-learning">Active Learning</h3> <p>Active learning strategies were employed to minimize annotation requirements. Models would automatically annotate samples, and only corrections made by annotators were required. This greatly improved annotation speed.</p> <h3 id="image-augmentation">Image Augmentation</h3> <p>To address the need to handle various technical challenges, including clutter, occlusion, diverse lighting &amp; camera angles, and diversity of equipment, extensive data augmentation was performed. Additionally, synthetic data was generated using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), contributing to the robustness of the model.</p> <h3 id="model-development">Model Development</h3> <p>Various algorithms, models, and frameworks were tested, including a modified Faster R-CNN approach for object detection. The original model was not well-suited for recognizing small objects, so it was tailored to this specific use case.</p> <h3 id="activity-recognition">Activity Recognition</h3> <p>Various algorithms for deep activity recognition were tested to accurately identify and classify different construction site activities.</p> <h3 id="tracking">Tracking</h3> <p>Kalman filtering was employed to track individual equipment through the site. Re-identification was a challenge that was overcome using Kalman filtering and visual similarity using DNN features.</p> <h2 id="business-impact">Business Impact</h2> <p>The deployment of our AI monitoring solution at client construction sites significantly improved operational efficiency and resource allocation. By offering real-time visibility into dump truck activities, our technology facilitated more effective scheduling, reduced idle times, and enabled better resource management, resulting in notable cost savings and enhanced productivity.</p> <h3 id="project-achievements">Project Achievements</h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Enhanced Efficiency:</strong> Improved scheduling and utilization of dump trucks, significantly reducing operational costs and enhancing project timelines.</li> <li> <strong>Data-Driven Decision Making:</strong> Provided invaluable insights into dump truck operations, empowering the client with information to influence future project management strategies.</li> <li> <strong>Scalable and Versatile Solution:</strong> Demonstrated the adaptability and scalability of our AI technology, highlighting its potential for broader applications within the construction industry and beyond.</li> <li> <strong>Metrics for Productivity:</strong> Enabled the measurement of equipment/labor activity and correlated with progress metrics from other sources such as drone data, facilitating smart estimation and bidding.</li> </ul> <p>This report encapsulates our achievements in this client project, demonstrating technological innovation to solve the problem of digitizing and monitoring construction site operations.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Vineeth Veetil.
